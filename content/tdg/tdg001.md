1. Set a metronome to 60 BPM. We will be playing half notes (two clicks per note).

2. Progress through the entire circle of fourths, finding and playing each note on the first 12 frets.

First you will find the note B on every string, then note E, and so on, finishing with the note G&flat;.

For each note, first play ascending from the lowest string to the highest string, playing the note on each string in turn. **Then return descending** playing first on the thinnest string and progressing to the thickest. For some strange reason, going in both directions seems to assist with memorization.

Pass criteria: Successfully work through all 12 notes while keeping time and without any flubs or misses. It's okay to wait up to a full bar before moving onto the next note in the cycle-of-fourths, but you must play each note on all six string in half note time without missing a beat.
